		<h1>Game title</h1>
		<p>This game was made for the Coastal Hacks hackathon. The theme of the hackathon was wellness. We decided to take this in a direction of food shopping habbits.
			The goal of the game is to do your shopping but balance it out so that you don't buy too much unhealthy food but also to buy things from your shopping list. <br>
			The game was made by Erik Leclercq, Ojan Hodjat, Linus Gäddnäs and Joel Nylund.
